# WordBuddy – English Vocabulary Builder App

WordBuddy is an English vocabulary learning app focused on the **650 most frequent and useful English words**. It helps learners build a solid vocabulary foundation through images, sounds, and repeated practice.

- **Not a translation app:** WordBuddy prioritizes **correct pronunciation** and auditory memory over direct translation.
- Uses **images and sounds** to stimulate memory and aid recall.
- Implements **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)** — a scientifically proven method to help transfer vocabulary from short-term to long-term memory by reviewing words at optimal intervals.

You can install the app on your phone [using this link.](https://expo.dev/accounts/sasadangelo/projects/word-buddy/builds/2270cc4c-46d4-4dbb-97e3-d49fdee142a6) or using the following QR Code:
